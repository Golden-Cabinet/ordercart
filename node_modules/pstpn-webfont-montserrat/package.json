The goal is to rescue what is in Montserrat.\n\nAs urban development changes this place, it will never return to its\noriginal form and loses forever the designs that are so special and\nunique. To draw the letters, I rely on examples of lettering in the\nurban space. Each selected example produces its own variants in length,\nwidth and height proportions, each adding to the Montserrat family. The\nold typographies and canopies are irretrievable when they are replaced.\n\nThere are other revivals, but those do not stay close to the originals.\nThe letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care,\ncolor, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that\nmake the city look so beautiful.\n\n\n\n## About the Author\n\nJulieta is a graphic designer and owner of ZkySky, a design studio which she\nco-founded in 1989 after earning a degree in Typeface Design. She lives\nand works in Montserrat, the first and oldest neighborhood in Buenos Aires.\nJulieta admires many type designers including Harald Geisler, and fellow\nArgentines Juan Pablo del Peral and Alejandro Paul. She is currently\ndeveloping new variants of Montserrat—italics, plus new weights and\nstyles—and dreams that it will soon become a large, extended family.\n\n\n\n## Copyright Notice\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012, Julieta Ulanovsky (julieta.ulanovsky@gmail.com), with Reserved Font Names 'Montserrat'\r\nThis Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.\r\nThis license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nSIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPREAMBLE\r\nThe goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide\r\ndevelopment of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation\r\nefforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and\r\nopen framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nThe OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and\r\nredistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.

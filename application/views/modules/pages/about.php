  <h1>OUR PRINCIPLES</h1>

  <p><span class="home_emphasized">QUALITY</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept nothing less than the best, most authentic products for ourselves, and we extend this same demand for quality to every product we sell to our customers. <a href="/source/">Click here</a> to learn more about how we source our products and assure that all custom formulas are prepared with accuracy and precision</p>

  <p><span class="home_emphasized">SERVICE</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We run the place, but this is your pharmacy. We're always happy to answer your questions and make sure that you're confident in the products you buy. We also go out of our way to make sure all our services are provided quickly, efficiently, and with a smile. We truly believe that it is both an honor and a pleasure to serve you and our community</p>

  <p><span class="home_emphasized">FAIR PRICING</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made a deliberate effort to keep our prices as low as possible, allowing more people to experience the healing benefits of this ancient medicine. Ultimately, we value service, relationships and quality over expansion and large profits.</p>

  <p><span class="home_emphasized">COMMUNITY</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our pharmacy to be more than a dispensary, we want it be a meeting place where the Chinese medicine community comes to share ideas about their practice or where anyone can just relax and have a cup of tea and some conversation. Think of it as the barber shop of herbal pharmacies. We're interested in you and not just your business.</p>

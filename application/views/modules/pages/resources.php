                <ol>
                    <li>Before you light the moxa stick, check it for cracks. Large cracks in the stick can increase the chances of a piece of burning moxa breaking off and falling.
                        <div class="alert alert-info">Use caution if you find cracks.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>Light one end of the stick over the flame of a gas stove or a candle. Rotate the stick in the flame to light it evenly all the way around.
                        <div class="alert alert-info">Moxa sticks are difficult to light with an ordinary lighter and the lighter will likely get too hot to touch.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>The end of the moxa stick will glow red when it is lit and ready for use.</li>
                    <li>As you use the moxa, scrape all sides of the stick on an ashtray, jar, or other hard, non-flammable container to prevent ash from building up.  Eventually the stick will be shaped like the tip of a pencil.</li>
                    <li>Use the moxa stick as directed by your practitioner.
                        <div class="alert alert-info">If an area of your body lacks sensation (i.e. it’s numb to the touch) carefully monitor how hot the area is by feeling the heat level with your other hand.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>To extinguish the moxa stick, fill a glass jar about half way with sand and submerge the lit end of the moxa in the sand until it is fully out. You can store the moxa in this jar of sand in between uses.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you have any questions or doubts, please contact your practitioner.</p>

                <h2 class='dashboard-title pull-left'>Granule Formula Instructions</h2>
                <div class="alert"><strong>Please follow your practitioner's instructions.</strong> The information on this site is meant as general guidelines and your practitioner knows your situation better than we do.</div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Shake your bottle or bag of herbs thoroughly before each use. Add the prescribed number of scoops to a non-aluminum cup or glass.  Each scoop is equal to approximately 1.5 grams.</li>
                    <li>Pour enough boiling water over the herbs to fully dissolve them.</li>
                    <li>Wait 30-60 seconds and then stir vigorously to help fully dissolve the granules.
                        <div class="alert alert-info">Most of our granules are from a company called Legendary Herbs and their granule size is larger than many other brands. While the flavor and aromas of the herbs are better than smaller granules, it may take a little more work to get them to fully dissolve.</div>
                    </li>

                    <li>If you want to drink your formula immediately, you can add cold water as soon as the herbs are dissolved to bring it to the desired temperature.  Otherwise, just wait until your formula cools off enough to drink comfortably.</li>
                    <li>If the flavor of the formula is tolerable, it is beneficial to take your time drinking it—the flavors and aromas are an integral part of the medicine and will make the herbs even more effective.
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <h5>If the flavor is truly intolerable, you have some options</h5>
                            <ul><li>The best option is to simply use less water and quickly drink your formula, followed by something that tastes better as a “chaser”.</li>
                                <li>Alternatively, you can skip the decoction and just mix the dry granules into applesauce or a similar food.</li>
                                <li>If this is still too much, you can always put your formula into empty gel-caps.  However, this is quite time consuming and you do not get the full benefit of the herb flavors.</li></ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <p>Please ask your practitioner before adding any sweetener to your formula!  All sweeteners have their own energetic properties and may or may not complement what your formula is doing.</p>
                    <p>We encourage you to try to embrace Chinese Medicine fully by experiencing the flavors and sensations involved in drinking your herbal decoction. It is amazing what your taste buds can tolerate when something is beneficial to your current health condition.</p>

			How do I know that the herbs used in my formula are free of pesticides and other chemicals?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
		All of the herbs we source undergo advanced microbiology testing to confirm the absence of microorganisms and pesticide residues, as well as advanced heavy metal testing.  These tests are conducted on both the raw material as well as the finished product, and are verified by secondary independent labs.

			What do I do if I’ve lost my spoon?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
			A dosage spoon will be included with each formula. If you lose your spoon you can always use a standard baking tsp to control your dosage.  1 level tsp = approx. 3g of granules.

			How do I prepare my formula?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
			Shake your bottle of herbs thoroughly before each use.  Add the prescribed number of level scoops to non-aluminum cup or glass.  Bring water to a boil and pour the water over the herbs enough to fully dissolve your granules.  Wait 30- 60 seconds; then stir vigorously to help them fully dissolve.  If you want to drink your formula immediately, add cool water to the fully dissolved tea to bring it to a desired temperature.

			What if I don’t like the taste of my formula?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
			If the flavor of your formula is truly intolerable, you have some options.  The best option is to simply use less water and quickly drink your formula, followed by something that tastes better as a “chaser”.  Alternatively, you can skip the decoction and just mix the dry granules into applesauce or a similar food.  If this is still too much to tolerate, you can always put your formula into empty gel-caps.  **Please ask your practitioner before adding any sweetener to your formula!  All sweeteners have their own energetic properties and may or may not complement what your formula is doing.

			What do I do if my bottle says zero refills available?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
			If you don’t show any available refills on your bottle, contact your practitioner to let them know.  They will be able to request additional refills from us. If you prefer, you can also give us a call and we will contact your practitioner on your behalf.

		<div class="faq_question faq_closed" onclick="toggleFAQ(this); return false;">
			Should I take my herbs with or without food?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
			Generally speaking, it is best to enjoy your formula at least one hour before or after a meal. If the dosage on your bottle does not specify whether to take your formula with or without food, check in with your practitioner.  They will have the best answer for you and your situation.
		</div>
		<div class="faq_question faq_closed" onclick="toggleFAQ(this); return false;">
			Why is my formula ID number different this time?
		</div>
		<div class="faq_answer">
			Each and every formula has an individual and unique formula ID number, even if it is an exact duplicate of a previous formula.  This system allows for us to track and control inventory, as well as locate your prescription quickly and confidently when you request a refill.
